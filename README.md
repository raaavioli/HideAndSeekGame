## Hide And Seek - The Game

### What is this?
This is a small 3D Hide and seek game developed as a side project to learn more about the OpenGL API, game engines 
and general game development. The Engine is built following the development of the [Hazel Engine](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel) by 
@TheCherno. (https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject)

I am planning to continue developing this game as part of an internet programming course, with which the goal is to make a simple online
multiplayer game with a server connecting at least two players together.
